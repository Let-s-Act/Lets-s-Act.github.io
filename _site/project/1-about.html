<h6 id="lets-act-pgh-started-right-before-the-pandemic-and-went-through-multiple-iterations-before-becoming-the-website-that-you-are-exploring-today-we-originally-came-up-with-the-idea-to-do-a-theatre-of-the-oppressed-to-project-focused-on-the-education-system-with-high-school-aged-youth-after-doing-similar-work-with-educators-starting-in-2017-with-funding-from-the-rivers-community-foundation-and-remake-learning-we-wanted-to-center-youth-voices-in-the-discussions-around-school-reform-and-liberatory-education-practices">Let’s Act PGH started right before the pandemic and went through multiple iterations before becoming the website that you are exploring today. We originally came up with the idea to do a Theatre of the Oppressed (TO) project focused on the education system with high school-aged youth after doing similar work with educators starting in 2017. With funding from the Rivers Community Foundation and Remake Learning, we wanted to center youth voices in the discussions around school reform and liberatory education practices.</h6>
<h6 id="our-main-objective-for-this-project-was-to-share-to-tools-with-a-core-group-of-student-leaders-who-would-then-share-what-they-learned-with-their-communities-our-goals-were-to-analyze-and-unpack-systems-of-oppression-in-our-education-system-share-our-lived-experiences-of-these-oppressions-and-use-these-experiences-as-learning-opportunities-to-rehearse-alternatives-and-enact-positive-change">Our main objective for this project was to share TO tools with a core group of student leaders who would then share what they learned with their communities. Our goals were to analyze and unpack systems of oppression in our education system; share our lived experiences of these oppressions; and use these experiences as learning opportunities to rehearse alternatives and enact positive change.</h6>

We made it through two workshops before the pandemic shut everything down. It took about a year for us to start the project up again, this time transitioning to an online platform using Zoom and other innovative platforms such as Gather and Google Jamboard. By then, we were all starting to get a little burned out by virtual programming, especially students who were in school online all day, 5 days a week. For this reason, we invited participants of the Braddock Youth Project to rejoin the program and also opened participation to other high school-aged youth in the region.</h6>

Participants were monetarily compensated for their time, creative labor, and expertise. We also set up snack deliveries so that we could experience the community building action of breaking bread together.</h6>

As facilitators, our primary goals were to develop community, foster trust, and create an environment where the youth could feel like they could take risks and be honest about their experiences in the education system. Our time together was slow, spontaneous, thoughtful, and nonlinear.</h6>

We encourage you to explore the pages in a way that makes sense for you, but please listen to some of the Conversations and Provocations from our youth artists.</h6>
