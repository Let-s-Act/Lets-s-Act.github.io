## Poetry

### Power, by Kat

###### The concept of power is a powerful thing
###### Power over people because we care more about the materialistic things
###### But it goes deeper than the green
###### Power is about control 
###### Control over the mind and body 
###### Control over what people see and or do
###### Control over what they hear
###### Power is control.

### Passed the Class, by Kat and shakyna

##### Kat: 
###### The education system is failing kids
###### Teaching us how to get good grades
###### If you don’t have straight A’s that makes you a failure
###### If you have dreams beyond the textbook it makes you unreal
###### And if your dream is TOO big you can’t achieve it
###### Our education is a lie
###### Made into manipulators
###### Who tell us we cant be dreamers
###### Not in this school 
###### Within those walls we are prisoners
###### Told what to wear, when to wake, when to sleep, when to eat, when to use the restroom?
###### When to talk, to whom we can talk to, when to be quiet.
###### How to listen to authority
###### Not to be leaders but to learn to follow, when to listen
###### And if you do a good job, inmate, you get rewarded
###### We were young
###### 5th grade lunch time
###### When its time to eat stand in yet another line
###### The cafeteria was loud
###### But the teaches wanted us to be quiet
###### We were kids
###### They didn't want us socializing with other students
###### This was our only break of the day so silence was broken
###### But the teachers wanted us to be quiet
###### If you couldn’t hear a pin drop here comes punishment
###### Recess was next
###### We walked along the big fence surrounding us
###### In silence
###### Guess we weren't quiet enough so they took the life out of our freedom
###### Punishment...
###### But it’s okay cause I passed the class right?

##### shak:
###### Report to cell 101 and 2:00 on the dot
######  dont be late 
###### Speak when spoken to no more no less
###### Raise your hand
######  And do your busy work 
###### Doesnt matter how much being busy hurts 
###### They own you
###### The people make school tolerable 
###### We help each other cause we know how it feels 
###### But they have deemed our points unadmitable 
###### The classroom is a place to learn  
###### So whats with all the ridicule 
###### Take what we want to do with our life and teach it
###### And thats only the minimal 
###### Education is so much more than just the literal 
###### Just like reactions are more than just the chemical 
###### They want to meet the status quo 
###### When we really need to change how the status goes 
###### They forget school raised some of us 
###### Now some of us are trapped in a schedule of what they describe as usual 
###### Preparing us to take commands 
###### Instead of thinking with our own minds 
###### To fall in line when the top dog comes by
###### Teaching us to be employees instead of bosses 

### Eyes, by Javier

##### Eyes
##### Eyes are a confusing thing
##### Always darting left and right
##### What do they mean
##### What’s behind them
##### Eyes cut more than words
##### Worse than rumors eyes stare directly at you
##### Brown pupil, brown pupil, brown pupil, blue
##### Though words hurt too
##### Eyes are just more upfront
##### How can something so small be so confusing
##### Is something on my face
##### Is it my face itself
##### Are you just staring into the distance
##### Don’t be quick to judge, it’s not you there staring at
##### If you stare back they’re the one uncomfortable
##### It gets better the more time you take with them
##### Though are you just one of the good ones
##### Brown pupil, brown pupil, blue 
##### Show off be better
##### you’re a representative
##### Answer the questions
##### Ignore the eyes
##### Be better 
##### Don’t forget where you come from
##### Why can’t you just blend in
##### Brown pupil, brown pupil, blue
##### If you blend in are you forgetting where you come from
##### Screw it I’m done
##### brown pupil, brown pupil, brown

### Do Your Homework, by Javier
##### You have to get good grades
##### though grades don’t matter
##### We just want to make sure you understand the curriculum
##### But don’t get bad grades
##### X Y Z
##### Solve for x
##### Where x is you
##### What are you worth
##### Well your tuition is worth a lot so don’t waste it
##### Talk to your friends at lunch laugh have fun
##### Though don’t have too much
##### We wouldn’t want to be disruptive
##### X equals Intelligence?
##### Don’t finish the test too early
##### Wait till the others are done
##### Be the best but fit in
##### We care for you
