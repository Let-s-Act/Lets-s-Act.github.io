## Poetry

### Power, by Kat

##### The concept of power is a powerful thing
##### Power over people because we care more about the materialistic things
##### But it goes deeper than the green
##### Power is about control 
##### Control over the mind and body 
##### Control over what people see and or do
##### Control over what they hear
##### Power is control.

### Passed the Class, by Kat and shakyna

##### Kat: 
##### The education system is failing kids
##### Teaching us how to get good grades
##### If you don’t have straight A’s that makes you a failure
##### If you have dreams beyond the textbook it makes you unreal
##### And if your dream is TOO big you can’t achieve it
##### Our education is a lie
##### Taught by teachers who settled to be educators
##### Made into manipulators
##### Who tell us we cant be dreamers
##### Not in this school 
##### Within those walls we are prisoners
##### Told what to wear, when to wake, when to sleep, when to eat, when to use the restroom?
##### When to talk, to whom we can talk to, when to be quiet.
##### How to listen to authority
##### Not to be leaders but to learn to follow, when to listen
##### And if you do a good job, inmate, you get rewarded
##### We were young
##### 5th grade lunch time
##### When its time to eat stand in yet another line
##### The cafeteria was loud
##### But the teaches wanted us to be quiet
##### We were kids
##### They didn't want us socializing with other students
##### This was our only break of the day so silence was broken
##### But the teachers wanted us to be quiet
##### If you couldn’t hear a pin drop here comes punishment
##### Recess was next
##### We walked along the big fence surrounding us
##### In silence
##### Guess we weren't quiet enough so they took the life out of our freedom
##### Punishment...
##### But it’s okay cause I passed the class right?

##### shak:
##### Report to cell 101 and 2:00 on the dot
#####  dont be late 
##### Speak when spoken to no more no less
##### Raise your hand
#####  And do your busy work 
##### Doesnt matter how much being busy hurts 
##### They own you
##### The people make school tolerable 
##### We help each other cause we know how it feels 
##### But they have deemed our points unadmitable 
##### The classroom is a place to learn  
##### So whats with all the ridicule 
##### Take what we want to do with our life and teach it
##### And thats only the minimal 
##### Education is so much more than just the literal 
##### Just like reactions are more than just the chemical 
##### They want to meet the status quo 
##### When we really need to change how the status goes 
##### They forget school raised some of us 
##### Now some of us are trapped in a schedule of what they describe as usual 
##### Preparing us to take commands 
##### Instead of thinking with our own minds 
##### To fall in line when the top dog comes by
##### Teaching us to be employees instead of bosses
