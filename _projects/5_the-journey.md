## Check-Ins

##### At the start of every session, we took some time to check in with one another to see how everyone was feeling that day. We offered a variety of options to gather this information and used Jamboard as a visual aid. These check-ins often set the tone for the rest of our time together.

## Questions, Activities, and Games

##### Our journey was not linear or straightforward, but we did emphasize inquiry, curiosity, and play. Here are just some of the questions, activities, and games that we experienced together, captured via Jamboard.

## Bringing it all together

##### Our "final product" was a truly collaborative effort as we considered who our audience would be, how to structure the content, our guiding questions, and how to present it all to the public.
